# The Learning Only License (LOL)

This idea came from some research I was doing in the differences between all of
the available licenses for online publication of documents and software. In a
comment to a blog article at
https://blog.codinghorror.com/pick-a-license-any-license/
a user by the moniker "app" described a license he or she would use in online
chatroom environments when helping students learn to code.

Too many students (whether at school or home) have a tendency to just copy the
code others make available and never take the time to actually understand how
the code was written and how it works. The idea of this license was to 
emphasize how the code should be used.

Nothing in the "license" is actually different from current expectations and
legal protections against plagiarism, but it does have the benefit of 
explicitly declaring intent, and encouraging users to keep that in mind when
reusing code or information in other places. It's a good reminder to us all
how we should approach other people's work that have been made publicly
available through altruism.

The license can be used by itself, essentially making the work public domain,
but it can also be tacked on to other existing licenses, as nothing in it
will cause conflict with licenses for other purposes. Again, it is primarily
a declaration of intent as to why the work is being made available.

When combining this license with other licenses, its shortened acronym can be
used as a prefix. For example, if combining this license with the BSD 3-clause
license, together they can be called the LOL-BSD3 license. Likewise combining
with the MIT license creates the LOL-MIT license, and with the GPL license we
have the LOL-GPL license. In each case, the primary license is retained, with
the LOL adding only a declaration of educational intent to the release of the
work.

Included are examples of the LOL itself, as well as combined with various 
license frameworks as needed.

The text of this license is being released under the Unlicense, and so should 
be considered free for use with no restrictions or requirements. I'm putting it
here simply to formalize the idea. While I have no way to contact the person
who originated the idea, I'll publicly express my gratitude to that person,
whoever you are. I have changed a few things to make it flow better when 
combining with other licenses and to formalize the language a bit.
